![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)

A time series forecasting project that predicts future sales trends for a retail business using Python. This project utilizes Prophet, Scikit-learn, and other essential data science tools for sales prediction and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a sales forecasting model using historical retail data. It helps in identifying patterns, trends, and making informed business decisions.

---

## 📈 Objectives

- Forecast future sales using time series analysis.
- Identify sales trends and seasonality.
- Visualize and evaluate model performance.

---

## 💡 Skills Gained

- **Time Series Forecasting**  
- **Regression Modeling**  
- **Trend & Seasonality Analysis**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Historical retail sales data.
- Fields include item info, store info, and sales data.
- Frequency: Monthly (simulated from row count for modeling).

---

## 🧪 Modeling Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Simulated date column for Prophet modeling.
   - Encoded categorical variables for regression.

2. **Prophet Model**
   - Trained for time series forecasting.
   - Visualized trends, seasonality, and future predictions.

3. **Regression Models**
   - Built additional models using Scikit-learn.
   - Used `mean_absolute_error` and `mean_squared_error` for evaluation.

---

## 📊 Results

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 880.33  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 1093.54  
- Visualizations show clear trends and seasonality patterns.

---

## 📉 Visualizations

- Forecast plot with trends and uncertainty intervals.
- Component plots showing trend and seasonality.
- Sales over time.

---

## 🚀 Deliverables

- Fully working forecasting model.
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE).
- All visualizations embedded in the notebook.
